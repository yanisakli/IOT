# Presentation
    Today there are different products with the same name (connected cushion), but with a different purpose than our product.
    This is particularly the case with the connected cushion, Viktor. Recently released at the end of 2019, which targets an elderly population (60 to 69 years old) and whose objective is to reduce the social distancing with our seniors. The purchase price of this product is 250 euros.
    There is also the Pillow Talk, which is a cushion that allows you to "get closer" to your spouse, via a device that includes a heart rate monitor, which reacts to the latter by emitting lights and allows you to listen to the other person's heartbeat. This product is intended for people with an average age of about 30 years. The purchase price of this product is 165 euros.
    Other products, such as the Zeeq, aim to improve the quality of sleep, for example by preventing snorers from snoring or cushions to reduce stress and anxiety.
    It is therefore noted that there are different connected cushions but that their uses can be completely different and the exercise of its application can be very broad.
    The average price for a connected cushion is on average 200 euros and tends to be aimed at an average age group (30-40 years old) mostly.
